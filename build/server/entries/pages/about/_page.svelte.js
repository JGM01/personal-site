I'm Jacob (Wubbzee on some platforms, JGM on others). I am a big fan of computers, and everything involving them.

This website is intended to be a bucket for things I do, as well as opinions and predictions I want to look back on in 5+ years and verify my correctness. This is a fairly broad description, so expect stuff like:</p> <ul class="text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 list-disc list-inside my-8"><li>Art</li> <li>Computer talk</li> <li>Photography</li> <li>Projects</li> <li>Jotted-down ideas</li></ul> <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 my-8">Improving my writing skills is another goal of this website, I feel like my writing is very boring/plain and would like to see it become more like some folks I've read on sites like lesswrong (lol).</p></div>`;
