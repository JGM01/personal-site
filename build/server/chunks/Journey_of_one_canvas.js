    Nothing too crazy, but then I stumbled upon this particular canvas. I thought it was funny, so I'm putting it here. This is pretty consistent with how I do things on any given canvas,
    just that I normally delete the them after some amount of time.</p> <video loop autoplay muted playsinline pointer-events-none="" class="rounded-3xl shadow-xl w-full h-full mx-auto my-4"><source src="/timelapse1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 my-4">A lot of the first attempts are just some head shots and eyes. This is almost stereotypical (a single eye drawn on a piece of paper), but what I think I'm doing when I do that is 
        hunting for an emotion to portray in a larger drawing later. For example, drawing a particularly mean or angry looking eye might inspire an entire facial expression piece with a similarly mean look.</p> <video loop autoplay muted playsinline pointer-events-none="" class="rounded-3xl shadow-xl w-full h-full mx-auto my-4"><source src="/timelapse2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 my-4">I started practicing gesture drawing by this point. Note how I gave up and went back to drawing a face lol. Anatomy is probably one of my stronger areas, but I am extremely weak in composition and posing. 
    Personally, I think I did a pretty good job hatching the buff guy even if the posing was super stiff.</p> <video loop autoplay muted playsinline pointer-events-none="" class="rounded-3xl shadow-xl w-full h-full mx-auto my-4"><source src="/timelapse3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 my-4">I liked the composition of the two guys staring eachother down. It felt very JoJo's in a way. But alas, I gave up and started drawing arms.</p> <video loop autoplay muted playsinline pointer-events-none="" class="rounded-3xl shadow-xl w-full h-full mx-auto my-4"><source src="/timelapse4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 my-4">This one has potential if I ever were to final-product-ize any of these. I think the idea of someone kinda pulling their weapon out of the ground is cool.
    I'm imagining a decent amount of post-processing (i.e. applying some varied blur for "heatwaves"), maybe some shining and glow from the armor/weapon/lightning. I like it.</p></div>`;
