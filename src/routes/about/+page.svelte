Hello!! 

I'm Jacob (Wubbzee on some platforms, JGM on others). I am a big fan of computers, and everything involving them.

This website is intended to be a bucket for things I do, as well as opinions and predictions I want to look back on in 5+ years and verify my correctness. This is a fairly broad description, so expect stuff like:
</Paragraph>
<ul class="text-lg/6 md:text-xl/8 list-disc list-inside my-4">
    <li>Art</li>
    <li>Computer talk</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>Jotted-down ideas</li>
</ul>
<Paragraph>
Improving my writing skills is another goal of this website, I feel like my writing is very boring/plain and would like to see it become more like some folks I've read on sites like lesswrong (lol). 
</Paragraph>
